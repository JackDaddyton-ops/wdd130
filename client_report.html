            <ul>
                <li>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</li>
                <p>I wanted a website about the pomodoro study method which is named after pomodoro timers. They are
                    like
                    egg timers except they are shaped like tomatos instead of eggs. Pomodoro is Italian for egg, So I
                    chose
                    images and colors that remind me of Italian food.</p>
                <li>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</li>
                <p>When I originaly came up with the website idea, I thought that I would be developing it myself and
                    had planned to vibe-code a pomodoro timer into it. The lead developer for my website emailed me
                    about it, but before I could give them alternative content, they already took care of it and put the
                    timer on one of the child pages. I also failed to communicate what resources to make links too. They
                    were supposed to be links to YouTube videos to pomodoro timer videos and stuff.</p>
                <li>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</li>
                <p>Yes! For what I gave them to work with, They did a great job.</p>
                <li>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</li>
                <p>I will put more energy into creating a good site plan that will be readable and make sense to people
                    other than myself.</p>

            <h2>Lead Developer Report:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</li>
                <p>I didn't really get to work with my junior developers for reasons that will be answered in the
                    following question.</p>
                <li>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</li>
                <p>I got an email from the client, of a generic wireframe without colors, images, or content,
                    with the subject called "Wireframe (inprogress)". I didn't get a real siteplan until the monday
                    after this assignment is due. It's partially my fault for not following up with him a lot sooner.
                    Since the email said "in progress," I assumed he would just send it whenever he got done.</p>
                <li>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</li>
                <p>I didn't really have to worry about coordinating with anyone for publishing the site. Since I got the
                    site plan last minute (infact, it was today, Dec 17 2025), I just put the website together myself.
                    I just emailed the client the link after I was done working on it.</p>
                </p>
                <li>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</li>
                <p>Like with anything new, it took some time to familiarize myself before I knew what I was doing. I
                    spent way too much time trying to find links to my websites before I realized I hadn't even deployed
                    them. smh</p>

            <h2>Junior Developer Report:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</li>
                <p>Communication went fairly well with the lead developer for one of the projects. With the other
                    though, I never even got put on the GitHub repo. The person who was supposed to be me co-junior dev,
                    said she hadn't heared from the lead dev either. For that reason, I only have a link one of of the
                    websites, the one I particepated in.</p>
                <li>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</li>
                <p>There's not much to say here. The lead dev just told me what page to work on an I did it. He was good
                    at delegating.</p>
                <li>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</li>
                <p>I was able to contribute to one of the sites.</p>
                <li>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?
                </li>
                <p>I didn't know how to edit files through github at first, so I edited a copy of the files on my laptop
                    and just copy/pasted them later. I forgot to copy/paste the changes I made to the css file I was
                    working on along side the html, so things looked a little funky until the lead dev fixed it.</p>

            <h2>General Experience and Reflections:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</li>
                <p>I think a lot of people in this class, including myself, struggled with communication. I think part
                    of the reason, at least for me, was because it was hard to remember all the different projects, the
                    other people involved in those projects, and their roles.</p>
                <li>What did you enjoy most about this project?</li>
                <p>I think deploying a website you made that other people can see is really cool. I also liked seeing
                    the changes different people made to the same projects I was a part of.</p>
                <li>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</li>
                <p>I think I would write down each project I was involved in, and a list for each project of things I
                    need to do(eg., people I need to email) in order to move forward with that project.</p>
                <li>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</li>
                <p>Yes. I think I have a clearer idea of what I need to do to communicate better with clients and team
                    members.</p>
